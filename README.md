## Overview

### Features

The ibank app is a web-based service designed for the management of one's bank account. It allows users to

- view their account balance
- view their account statement, presented as a history of trasnsactions
- send money to other accounts in the same bank
- send money to any mobile number (mimic withdrawal)

### Security

To access their account, users need to be authenticated.

The app manages user authentication using a third party identity as a service provider, name [Auth0](https://auth0.com).

With Auth0, users can login using

- an email and password combination
- social login via providers like Google

On sign in/up, Auth0 sends the user profle bakc to the app. The profile includes the user's email address, which matches the email address tied to their account.

### Data Models

The app achieves data persistence using a MySQL database.
It has tables for Users, Transactions and Accounts.

A Transaction is the most basic record in the database. It is defined by the fields:

- `transaction_id`: an autogenerated value used as the record's primary key
- `transaction_title`: a short textual description of the transaction
- `amount`: the amount of money involved in the transaction
- `timestamp`: a datetime record of when the transaction was made/recorded

### Feature Components

#### Home

Defines the site's landing page. Redirects to user's dashboard on successful authentication.

#### Transactions

Defines the transactions view. The default view is a table of transactions.

Each transaction includes a link to a page with a more detailed view of the transaction.

### (External/Other) Modules

The app employs these external libraries to achieve styling:

- [Bootstrap-v4](https://https://getbootstrap.com/)
